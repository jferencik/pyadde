This library is a python 3 implementation of UniWISC's ADDE client binary protocol.


The ADDE is little documented and is quite capable (it can resample images on the fly for example)
This lib can free you from  McIDASV and McIDAsX but it is not as stable/tested/advanced as this software packages are.
It uses python 3 (3.6 and onwards is best) and works in an asynchronous manner

SSEC has quite many ADDE servers and UCAR has some as well.

The lib depends on pyarea lib because ADDE actualy transfers McIDAS AREA files.
